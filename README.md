# flyway-playground

ðŸ“š Learning and exploring Flyway, the Java-based database migration tool.

> Database Migrations Made Easy.
> 
> --<cite> https://github.com/flyway/flyway/ </cite>


## Overview

This codebase defines an example SQL schema, an example Java program that connects to the database (Postgres), and uses
Flyway to apply the schema to the database via a so-called *database  migration*. Flyway is invoked by way of the Flyway
Gradle plugin.    


## Instructions

Follow these instructions to perform a database migration and run the sample program.

1. Use Java 17
2. Start the database
   * ```shell
     docker-compose up --detach
     ```
3. Run the database migration
   * ```shell
     ./gradlew flywayMigrate --info
     ```
   * The database tables and sample data were created!
   * Tons of stuff was logged to the screen unfortunately, but if you look closely you'll see something like:
     ```text
     ...omitted...
     Creating Schema History table "public"."flyway_schema_history" ...
     Migrating schema "public" to version "1 - observations-schema"
     Migrating schema "public" to version "2 - observations-data"
     Successfully applied 2 migrations to schema "public", now at version v2 (execution time 00:00.176s)
     ...omitted...
     ```
4. Run the Java program
   * ```shell
     ./gradlew run
     ```
   * Notice that the program successfully read from the table!
5. Stop the database
   * ```shell
     docker-compose down
     ```


## Reference

* [Flyway documentation](https://flywaydb.org/documentation/)
* [Flyway docs: "SQL-based migrations"](https://flywaydb.org/documentation/concepts/migrations#sql-based-migrations)
  > Migrations are most commonly written in SQL. This makes it easy to get started and leverage any existing scripts,
  > tools and skills. It gives you access to the full set of capabilities of your database and eliminates the need to
  > understand any intermediate translation layer.
  * This is a pragmatic approach in my opinion. I compare it to Liquibase where it's common (recommended?) to define
    migrations in the Liquibase language (well, config). I eventually settled on SQL-based migrations in Liquibase after
    some time. I think this is "the way".
  * The Flyway docs are great!
